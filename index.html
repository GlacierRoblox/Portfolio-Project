      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! I’m a JC1 student passionate about computer science and how
        technology shapes the world. I took H2 Computing because I love
        problem-solving and want to build cool projects that make an impact.
        Coding, algorithms, and logical thinking excite me, and I’m always
        looking to improve my skills.

      <h2>Activity</h2>
      <p>
        I took H2 Computing because I’ve always been interested in technology
        and how things work behind the scenes. Coding and problem-solving seem
        like useful skills, not just for future careers but also for everyday
        life. I’m hoping to get better at logical thinking, build cool projects,
        and maybe even create something that solves real-world problems. Plus,
        with technology evolving so fast, understanding computing feels like a
        solid way to stay ahead and keep my options open for the future!
